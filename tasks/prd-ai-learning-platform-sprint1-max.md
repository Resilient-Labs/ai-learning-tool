    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    total_sessions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_messages INTEGER DEFAULT 0,

CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_role ON users(role);
CREATE INDEX idx_conversations_user_id ON conversations(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_conversation_id ON messages(conversation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_messages_created_at ON messages(created_at);
