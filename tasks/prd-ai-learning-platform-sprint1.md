# Product Requirements Document: AI Learning Platform - Sprint 1

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The AI Learning Platform is designed to address Bloom's Two Sigma Problem by providing personalized, tutor-like support to Resilient Coders students. This platform will deliver adaptive learning experiences that help students master web development concepts at a pace and style that matches their individual learning needs.

**Problem Statement:** Current educational methods don't provide the personalized attention that leads to optimal learning outcomes. The Two Sigma Problem shows that one-on-one tutoring can improve student performance by two standard deviations compared to traditional classroom instruction.

**Solution:** An AI-powered learning platform that adapts to each student's learning pace and provides personalized explanations, creating a tutor-like experience at scale.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Personalized Learning Experience:** Create an AI tutor that adapts to individual student learning pace and provides explanations in different ways
- **Student Progress Tracking:** Enable instructors to monitor student progress, completion rates, and skill development
- **Foundation for Growth:** Build a scalable platform architecture that can support future features and increased user load

### Secondary Objectives
- **Real-time Analytics:** Provide instructors with insights to reinforce topics during lectures
- **Interview-Ready Features:** Create capabilities that students can showcase in job interviews
