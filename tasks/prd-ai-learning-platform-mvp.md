   - **Contingency:** Mandatory usage policies and support

#### Business Risks

8. **Cost Overruns:** Higher than expected operational costs
   - **Mitigation:** Cost monitoring, usage caps, efficient algorithms
   - **Contingency:** Feature reduction and cost optimization

9. **Timeline Delays:** Development takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation:** Agile methodology, regular reviews, scope management
   - **Contingency:** Feature prioritization and timeline adjustment

### 12.3 External Risks

#### Market and Regulatory Risks

10. **Privacy Regulations:** New compliance requirements
    - **Mitigation:** Privacy-by-design, regular compliance reviews
    - **Contingency:** Legal consultation and policy updates

11. **Technology Changes:** LLM provider changes or discontinuation
    - **Mitigation:** Provider diversification, abstraction layers
    - **Contingency:** Migration to alternative providers
