## ❌ Features OUT of Scope

### Advanced Features (Save for Later Sprints)
- Real-time WebSocket connections (use polling for now)
- Advanced AI personalization or context memory
- Code execution environment or syntax highlighting
- GitHub integration or project submissions
- Mobile native apps (web responsive only)

### Security & Performance (Basic Only)
- Multi-factor authentication (simple JWT only)
- Advanced rate limiting (basic only)
- Horizontal scaling (single instance for now)
- Advanced caching strategies

### Analytics (Keep Simple)
- Real-time analytics updates (batch processing only)
- Individual student conversation access for instructors
- Advanced reporting or data visualization
- Predictive analytics or ML insights

## ⚠️ Key Risks

### High Priority Risks (Address Day 1-2)
1. **LLM Provider Decision Delay** - Must choose OpenAI vs Anthropic by EOD Day 1
   - *Impact:* 6+ hour delay in chat functionality
   - *Mitigation:* Parallel evaluation, decision matrix ready, fallback to OpenAI

2. **Database Schema Complexity** - Over-engineering initial schema
   - *Impact:* 4+ hour delay, integration issues
   - *Mitigation:* Start with minimal schema, iterate in Sprint 2

3. **Team Task Coordination** - 18 engineers, 15 interconnected tasks
   - *Impact:* Integration failures, duplicate work
   - *Mitigation:* Daily 15-min standups, clear API contracts, task dependencies mapped

### Medium Priority Risks (Monitor Daily)
4. **AI Response Quality** - Initial responses may be generic or unhelpful
   - *Impact:* Poor demo, user dissatisfaction
   - *Mitigation:* Basic prompt engineering, simple feedback collection

5. **Authentication Integration** - Frontend/backend auth mismatch
   - *Impact:* 3+ hour debugging sessions
   - *Mitigation:* API contract defined Day 1, integration testing

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Technical Success (Must Meet)
- **Uptime:** 99%+ during demo hours (no critical crashes)
- **Response Time:** AI chat responses under 5 seconds (not 3s yet)
- **Deployment:** Successful production deployment with rollback capability
- **Test Coverage:** Basic tests for authentication and chat flow

### User Experience Success (Demo Ready)
- **Student Flow:** Register → Login → Send message → Receive AI response
- **Instructor Flow:** Login → View student list → See basic activity metrics
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failures with user-friendly messages
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and tablet

### Team Success (Process)
- **Task Completion:** 80% of 15 tasks completed on time
- **Integration:** No major blockers between frontend/backend teams
- **Documentation:** Basic API docs and setup instructions complete
- **Team Velocity:** Establish baseline for Sprint 2 planning
