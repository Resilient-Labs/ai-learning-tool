# Sprint 1 Brief: AI Learning Platform Foundation
**Week 1 of 8 | Team: 18 Engineers | Duration: 5 Days**

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Establish Core Infrastructure** - Set up authentication, database, and basic API foundation
2. **Enable AI Tutoring** - Create functional chat interface with LLM integration
3. **Build Analytics Foundation** - Implement basic instructor dashboard for student insights
4. **Ensure System Reliability** - Deploy with monitoring, testing, and CI/CD pipeline

### Success Definition
- Students can register, log in, and chat with AI tutor
- Instructors can view basic student progress analytics
- System operates with 99%+ uptime and <3s response times
- Foundation established for Sprint 2 development

---

## ✅ Features IN Scope

- JWT-based login/logout with role-based access (student/instructor)
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management

### AI Chat System
- Real-time chat interface with WebSocket connections
- LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic TBD)
- Conversation history storage and retrieval
- Basic message formatting and syntax highlighting

### Student Dashboard
- Clean chat interface for AI interactions
- Conversation history viewer
- Basic progress indicators
- Responsive design for desktop/tablet

### Instructor Analytics
- Student engagement metrics (sessions, time spent)
- Completion rates and basic progress tracking
- Topic difficulty identification
- Export functionality for reports

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database with proper schema
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Basic monitoring and logging
- Staging and production environments

---

## ❌ Features OUT of Scope

### Mobile Applications
- Native iOS/Android apps
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features

### Advanced Features
- Code execution environment
- GitHub integration
- Advanced personalization beyond basic conversation history
- Real-time analytics (batch processing only)
- Predefined lessons or curriculum management

### Security & Compliance
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Advanced audit logging
- Specific compliance frameworks (FERPA, GDPR)

### Performance & Scale
- Horizontal scaling beyond 50 concurrent users
- Advanced caching strategies
- Database optimization beyond basic indexing

---

## ⚠️ Key Risks

### High Priority Risks
1. **LLM Provider Selection Delay** - Team needs to choose OpenAI vs Anthropic by Day 2
   - *Impact:* Could delay chat functionality by 2-3 days
   - *Mitigation:* Parallel evaluation of both providers, decision framework ready

2. **Database Performance Issues** - PostgreSQL setup may not handle concurrent load
   - *Impact:* Slow response times, potential system crashes
   - *Mitigation:* Load testing early, connection pooling, proper indexing

3. **Team Coordination Challenges** - 18 engineers working on interconnected features
   - *Impact:* Integration issues, scope creep, missed deadlines
   - *Mitigation:* Daily cross-team standups, clear API contracts, feature flags

### Medium Priority Risks
4. **AI Response Quality** - Initial AI responses may be irrelevant or unhelpful
   - *Impact:* Poor user experience, low adoption
   - *Mitigation:* Prompt engineering, response monitoring, feedback collection

5. **Real-time Chat Scalability** - WebSocket connections may not scale to 50+ users
   - *Impact:* Chat failures, poor user experience
   - *Mitigation:* Load testing, connection pooling, Redis clustering if needed
